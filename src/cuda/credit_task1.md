# Credit Task A

## Tasks

Imagine an n-dimensional world where each individual is represented by an n-dimensional vector (position). There are `M` of these individuals in the world. Each individual can move in **any direction and at any speed**. The vector of this motion (velocity) will also be n-dimensional.

Create an application that does the following points at each step of the simulation:

1. Adjusts the velocities of each individual by the same three generated vectors, i.e.

    $$
    v_i = v_i + a + b + c
    $$

2. Each individual moves `5%` towards one pre-selected individual, e.g. an individual X has a pre-selected target individual Y, and another individual Z has a pre-selected individual W.

Your solution should be simple enough and can be written in a single *.cu file. You can use our template project. In that case, send me to my email only the single file.

Welcome to my virtual book, which originated as a personal knowledge base to complement my academic journey at [VSB-TUO](https://www.vsb.cz/en/). While the majority of notes are in Czech, a select few pages are available in English.

While you are, you can also visit my personal site [here](https://matejfric.github.io/).
